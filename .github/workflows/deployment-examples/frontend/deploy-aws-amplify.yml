# ⚠️  DEPLOYMENT EXAMPLE: AWS Amplify (Fullstack Frontend)
#
# 📌 HOW TO USE THIS FILE:
# 1. Create Amplify app in AWS Console
# 2. Connect GitHub repository
# 3. Copy to: .github/workflows/deploy-aws-amplify.yml
# 4. Add required secrets (see below)
# 5. Push to trigger deployment
#
# 📋 REQUIRED SECRETS (Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions):
#   - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: IAM user access key
#   - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: IAM user secret key
#   - AWS_REGION: e.g., us-east-1
#   - AMPLIFY_APP_ID: Found in Amplify console
#
# 📚 Documentation: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/
# 💰 Pricing: Pay-as-you-go (build: $0.01/min, hosting: $0.15/GB)
# ⚡ Benefits:
#   - Fullstack deployment (frontend + serverless backend)
#   - Built-in authentication and GraphQL
#   - Preview environments for PRs
#   - Integrated with other AWS services
# ⚠️  Considerations:
#   - AWS-specific (vendor lock-in)
#   - More expensive than static hosting
#   - Learning curve for Amplify ecosystem
